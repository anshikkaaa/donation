# Donation Dashboard ðŸ’°

This is a full-stack Donation Dashboard web application where users can log in, get a randomly assigned donation amount, generate referral codes, and view their rank on a leaderboard. All data is simulated using localStorage (no real backend).

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anshikkaaa/donation.git
cd donation

2. Start the Frontend (React)

cd internhub-client
npm install
npm start
Runs on http://localhost:3000

Simulates user login, donation amount, referral code, and a leaderboard with top 5 donors.

3. Backend Setup

cd ../backend
npm install
npm start
